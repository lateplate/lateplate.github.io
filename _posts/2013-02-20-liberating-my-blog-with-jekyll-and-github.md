title: Liberating My Blog With Jekyll and Github
---
I must switch blogging platforms at least once a year. 

I could never really put my finger on why. I suspect it was some combination of:

- Complexity and bloat. Wordpress, Tumblr, and even Squarespace boast tons of features, but I only use one: publishing.
- They all have their own theme engines. Custom CSS is painful to write around their markup.
- Composing in WYSIWYG editors is horrible. There are modules and toolbars everywhere. Auto-saving is poor. It's difficult to focus on writing.

I decided to give [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) a try. Being part of [The Starter League](http://starterleague.com) for the past five weeks, I knew I had enough HTML/CSS and RubyGems skills to get it working. 

Within a few hours, I was up and running. It's simple and liberating. Among the many reasons I love it:

- Jekyll runs on Github. I push to Github and my new blog post is live.
- I can write Markdown in beautiful editors like [iA Writer](http://www.iawriter.com). It's distraction free, easy to read, and fast.
- My content is never locked in and always local. Markdown is text, and Dropbox and Github save everything. I'm not beholden to anyone's export features.
- I can keep the HTML/CSS wonderfully simple, so it's blazingly fast. There's nothing wasted, and no vendor bloat for 99% of the features I don't need.

It takes a little work to get Jekyll running, but man is it worth it.
