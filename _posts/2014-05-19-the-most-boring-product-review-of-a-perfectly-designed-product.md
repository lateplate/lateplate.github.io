title: The Most Boring Product Review Of A Perfectly Designed Product
---
This has to be the most boring product review ever written, in the most boring product category. It's a review of my 7 year old [Braun WK200 Electric Kettle](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004S9H7/ref=oh_d__o00_details_o00__i01?ie=UTF8&psc=1) that's helped me make thousands of cups of coffee and tea.

_The Braun WK200 doesn't need a 12 page review because it's one of the simplest, most perfectly designed products I own. It does exactly one thing well - it boils water incredibly fast._

<br>

## It's beautifully simple. 

It has one button, one power indicator light, and a water level indicator. I add water, put it on the base, and press the button. 

The power indicator light turns on while it's heating, and it turns off when it's done. There are no unnecessary features - no timers, no temperature control, no audible alerts, and no extra buttons.

## It's incredibly functional. 

The pitcher is cordless, so I never get tangled up. It's made of plastic, greatly reducing any chances of burns. I can easily see how much water is in it at all times. It boils water within minutes. To clean it, I just wipe it with a damp cloth.

Perfectly designed products (even the boring ones) are exceedingly rare and highly subjective, but this is one of those. 

It's a damn shame you can't get one anymore.
