Yes, they do exist. Kudos to [ABC Bakers](http://www.abcsmartcookies.com/america’s-best-cookies) for making a few of their cookies vegan. From their FAQ:

>Yes, ABC has 4 vegan cookies in our product line – our Lemonades, Thanks-A-Lot, Thin Mints and Peanut Butter Patties are all vegan.

Unfortunately, the other supplier for the Girl Scouts, [Little Brownie Bakers](http://littlebrowniebakers.com) doesn't have any vegan options.

[Chicagoland's Girl Scout cookies](http://www.girlscoutsgcnwi.org/our-cookies) are made by Little Brownie Bakers, so there aren't any vegan options for us. Still, it's good to see that delicious treats like the [peanut butter patties](http://www.abcsmartcookies.com/peanut-butter-patties) can be made without any eggs or dairy.

If you're curious to see who makes your local cookies, punch in your zip code on the [Girl Scout Cookies site](http://www.girlscouts.org/program/gs_cookies/how_to_buy.asp) to find your local group and see which cookies they sell.
