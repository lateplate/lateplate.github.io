title: Keeping Busy
---

For the last few months I've been willfully unemployed. 

It's not ideal for our bank account, but it _is_ refreshing for the mind, body, and spirit. In the end, I think this break will lead to great things.

Here's what's been keeping me busy.

## Personal
* Watching [my boys grow up](http://photos.dankim.org/kids/share) every day. Most importantly, [teaching them about the Harlem Shake](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr_e7Fl1QIA).
* Staying active. Remembering to play with [Parker](http://photos.dankim.org/Pets), take more walks, and even shoot some hoops. (Note: the shooting hoops part was ugly.)
* Spring cleaning 2013 -- home version. I sold $2,500 of stuff on eBay, and donated tons of stuff to charity. 
* Spring cleaning 2013 -- mind version. I unfollowed dozens of people on Twitter and cut out mediocre RSS feeds. This strategy was inspired by Jonas Downey's ["What my daughter taught me about worrying"](http://jonas.do/writing/what-my-daughter-taught-me-about-worrying).
* Reading. Trying to finish up [Quiet](http://www.amazon.com/Quiet-Power-Introverts-World-Talking/dp/0307352153/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1368194405&sr=8-1&keywords=quiet) and [Dream Team](http://www.amazon.com/Dream-Team-Greatest-Conquered-Basketball/dp/0345520483/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1368194407&sr=8-1&keywords=dream+team). Both are excellent so far.
* Writing. Trying to keep this blog up to date and interesting.

## Professional
* Teaching (and learning) HTML by being a teaching assistant and mentor at [The Starter League](http://www.starterleague.com/).
* Learning the basics of Ruby. Wrote a quick class to see if I could [pull Twitter profile images](https://gist.github.com/lateplate/5554620).
* Built a site using [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/) for the first time.
* Learning more about [YAML](http://www.yaml.org/) and testing with [Rails Fixtures](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Fixtures.html).
* Guiding [Julie](http://twitter.com/juliekim2) with HTML and Git as she navigates the Beginner's HTML class at The Starter League. Only 6 weeks in and she's [creating great stuff](http://juliekim2.github.io/starterleague/experiments.html).
* Generally observing and learning from others. Watching, listening, and understanding how people operate and what motivates them.
* Researching and trying out the [jobs-to-be-done framework](http://jobstobedone.org/). I even did my [first JTBD interview with Julie](https://soundcloud.com/lateplate/jtbd-pants-from-the-limited).
