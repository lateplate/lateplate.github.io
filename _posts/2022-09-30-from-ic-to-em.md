title: From IC to EM – A guide to stepping into the weird, wild world of management
subtitle: Women Who Code Mobile Video and Slides
type: talk
---

### Summary:
So you’re thinking about becoming an engineering manager, eh? Awesome, let’s go!

I considered this exact same decision about a year ago, and ultimately ended up taking the leap. I’ll walk you through how I made the call to switch to being an EM after many years as an IC, how it started (what I thought I knew), how it’s going (all the things I didn’t know), and the not-so-obvious differences between being an IC and an EM. Basically, I’m here to give you a real world, very fresh perspective on what the transition has been like. 

Ultimately, I hope this talk will help you make a decision on what’s right *for you*, and if you do decide to head down the EM path, how to get started.
