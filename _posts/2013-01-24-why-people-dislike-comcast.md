title: Why People Dislike Comcast
---
While I was on hold for 90 minutes yesterday with Comcast, I had time to muse on why people dislike Comcast so much.

Beyond the obvious failure of keeping someone on hold for 90 minutes, a few things came to mind:

- Their customer service reps have little power to do anything. Initial call takers are nothing more than screeners. As a result, they transfer calls _a lot_. Not a great feeling as a customer.
- Their "on hold" messages are infuriating. You know what you don't want to hear when they've completely boned your account? How you can buy _more_ of their services or pay-per-view movies from them.
- There's almost no way to check their work. Even if you suspect something is wrong, there's no way to tell until something goes wrong. Rinse, repeat.
- Their customer site, automated phone system, and online chat are powerless to help you with any complex issues. Yet their strategy is to continue to push you to those systems to offload their call volume. They are motivated to get you off the phone, even if it doesn't actually help you.

Mistakes are OK. But how you handle them is the true test. And Comcast handles them poorly.
