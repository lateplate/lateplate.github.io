title: How Data Helped Me Lose 50 Pounds
---
Last January I became the proud new papa of twin boys. But I was also pushing 182 pounds, a 26.9 BMI, and 25% body fat. It was time to make some changes.

I had lost weight before, but my motivation this time was very different. This was about getting and _staying_ healthy for the sake of my new family.

I had to do two things for this to work.

## Correct the fundamental problem.
This was simple to identify and correct. I was eating like a jerk. Entire pizzas, burritos, cakes, chips, cookies, sodas, no fruit, no vegetables. You get the picture. 

**Solution**: stop eating like a jerk, and start eating a well-balanced diet.

## Create a system to manage and sustain weight loss.
This was the far more challenging (and interesting) part. How would I know if the changes to my diet were working? 

I needed data every day. I created a system around this idea.

1. **Track my food with [MyFitnessPal](http://www.myfitnesspal.com/).** Most importantly I would track every calorie input and output. Calories expended _must always_ exceed calories taken in, period.
2. **Track my physical activity with a [Fitbit](http://www.fitbit.com/product).** If I was being lazy, I would get moving. If I was being active, I could treat myself to a donut. (This may sound silly, but an occasional treat was crucial to staying motivated.)
3. **Track my weight with a [Withings wifi scale](http://www.withings.com/en/wirelessscale).** Did my food and activity choices show positive progress in my weight loss? The ability to adjust daily was absolutely crucial. I could immediately see what foods and levels of activity worked well.

I'm now at a healthy weight and BMI, have great cholesterol and blood pressure readings, and most importantly, feel great every day.
