title: Winding Down At Starter League
---
With only two weeks left, my time at [The Starter League](http://starterleague.com) is winding down. It's been an immensely rewarding experience, and I'm already getting nostalgic.

Saying [I've learned a lot](http://dankim.org/starterleague/) is a massive understatement. [Starter Night](http://starternight.splashthat.com/) is right around the corner, where we'll unveil the app we've been working on outside of class. I'm excited to show it to everyone.

I don't know exactly what I'll be doing next, but I'll carry the lessons of Starter League with me forever.
