title: I'm Grateful To Be Sick
---

Right now I’m sitting in a immediate care facility — one of those places you go when you’re sick and you can’t quite wait for your normal doctor.

I’ve had a pretty terrible sore throat and earache for the past few days and it’s come to a head on New Years Day, when nearly everything is closed. I’ve been in pain, grumpy, and tired for days.

And yet, I’m really kind of grateful for this illness.

**I’m grateful** that I’m in wonderful general health (an occasional illness like this aside!)

**I’m grateful** that within minutes, I was able to self diagnose my symptoms on Google as something that a professional should treat.

**I’m grateful** that, on New Year’s Day, an immediate care facility is open and taking patients.

**I’m grateful** that I was able to leave my children in my awesome wife’s care, hop in my car, and drive only 5 minutes to this care facility.

**I’m grateful** that I only waited 45 minutes to see a physician.

**I’m grateful** the physician was so easily able to diagnose my symptoms and prescribe medication, which will have me feeling better in just a few days.

**I’m grateful** I could take that prescription to Walgreens just down the block, where they have it in stock and filled within 30 minutes.

**I’m grateful** that I work for Basecamp, who takes wellness seriously. We have top notch insurance that ensures this isn’t a major financial burden. And I’m never pressured to “work through an illness” — sleep and rest are highly valued!

Don’t get me wrong. I’m not saying this has been a fantastic way to spend the last few days. Far from it. Activities were canceled. My wife had to pick up the slack with the kids. And I feel like a blob.

But anytime I get sick, it helps me realize how grateful I should be for what I do have. It truly is an opportunity to focus on the good in life. ☺
