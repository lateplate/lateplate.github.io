title: Commuting In Our Nissan Leaf Is 8x Cheaper Than A Gas Car
---

You read that right. Let's do some math to prove it.

Since electric and gas are measured in different units and capacities, I needed to calculate the cost to drive 1 mile for each. 

[My wife](https://twitter.com/juliekim2) drives a moderate 18 miles per day to and from work. This is normal. [Most people drive less than 40 miles per day](http://gm-volt.com/2007/12/06/how-did-gm-determine-that-78-of-commuters-drive-less-than-40-miles-per-day/).

So here's the math. (All numbers are rounded up or down for readability).

## Gas Car
* In 2012 [cars averaged 24 MPG](http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1081502_gas-mileage-keeps-rising-record-23-8-mpg-average-in-2012).
* In February 2013 the [average price for gas in Chicago was $3.93](http://www.bls.gov/ro5/aepchi.htm). Could be worse -- highs were around $4.28 in 2012.
* $3.93 per gallon of gas &divide; 24 miles per gallon = $.16 per mile.
* That's $2.88 a day to drive 18 miles.

## Nissan Leaf
* With a full battery, our Nissan Leaf averages 75 miles. (This is [an average based on varying conditions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan_Leaf#Range)).
* The battery [has a capacity of 24 kilowatt hours (kWh)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan_Leaf#Battery).
* In March 2013 [the average cost per kWh in my area never exceeded $.06](http://cloud.dankim.org/image/0X0n230A3J3F), and was often less.
* 24 kWh * $.06 = $1.44. _Translation: it costs $1.44 to fill the Leaf's battery to capacity, for which you will get 75 miles of range._
* $1.44 per full battery charge &divide; 75 miles per full battery = $.02 per mile.
* That's $.36 a day to drive 18 miles.

## Summary
* $2.88 to drive 18 miles per day in a gas car.
* $.36 to drive 18 miles per day in a Nissan Leaf.
* $2.88 / $.36 = 8. It's 8x more expensive to drive a gas car for a daily commute.

**Driving a Nissan Leaf every day to work saves us $2.52 per day. $12.60 a week. $50 a month. $600 a year. And that's just going to and from work.**
